### Hi there 👋

<!--
**fsanchez334/fsanchez334** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My name is Fernando Flores! I am a recent college graduate that studied Computer Science and Psychology. With these two fields of interest, I decided to focus on artificial intelligence. Through my course study, I began working on programs that implement machine learning models and AI algorithms. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on projects centered around artificial intellginece and data science (wrangling data and data manipulation)
- 🌱 I’m currently refreshing myself on concepts related to Calculus and linear algebra.
