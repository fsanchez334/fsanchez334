My name is Fernando Flores! I am a recent college graduate from Columbia University that studied Computer Science and Psychology. With these two fields of interest, I decided to focus on artificial intelligence. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects centered around artificial intellginece and data science (wrangling data and data manipulation)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently refreshing myself on concepts related to Calculus and linear algebra. 
- :zap: I enjoy reading plays, short stories, playing chess. When I am not doing that, I like to work on some independent projects in R and in Python
